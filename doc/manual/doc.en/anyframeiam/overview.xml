  <title>Anyframe IAM Overview</title>

  <para>Anyframe IAM is Identity and Access Management Framework that provides
  security solution(user authentication and authorization management) for enterprise
  application based on JAVA EE. Enterprise application based on JAVA EE has various
  required item for user authentication and authorization management and developing new
  functions every time for each enterprise application cost lots of additional
  money and resources. As the Anyframe IAM based on Spring Security is a
  framework that provides user authentication and authorization management for enterprise
  application based on Anyframe or spring Framework, it improves developing
  productivity, active for user authentication and authorization management and support
  for developing application of flexible form.</para>

        <para>As the strong and flexible security solution for enterprise

        The traditional Servlet specification security has the limited

        transference issue and web request, but the Spring Security
        offers service layer and domain object level security. Spring Security is 
        possible to secure under configuration. And its component is very excel at reusing.
        It is verified through many site under various environments and also the

        Anyframe IAM apply for making authentication and authorization based on DB.
        It also standardizes/extends function/refines requirement for management. 
        Through this, IAM Framework is implemented with strength of Spring Security and

      <title>IAM Core</title>

      <para>Core of Anyframe IAM is based on Spring Security, it is installed
      at business application based on Anyframe or Spring and
      authentication,authorization are added by minimizing a previous work
      code changing. Especially, operating based on extended setting
      information as DB base is different from Spring Security that save a
      configuration information as XML file.

          generally. IAM Core based on Spring Security can treat not only
          controlling for web request but security through authorization
          controlling for main object and service layer. And also it provides
          Tag and API related to view resource access that provides permission
